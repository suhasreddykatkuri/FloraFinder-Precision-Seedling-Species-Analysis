## Project Overview

FloraFinder utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify different species of seedlings from images. The project aims to provide a precise and efficient method for identifying plant species, which can be used for various applications in botany and agriculture.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Techniques such as resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes CNNs for image classification.
- **Evaluation**: Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **User Interface**: Simple interface for uploading images and getting classification results.

## Installation

To get started with FloraFinder, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/suhasreddykatkuri/FloraFinder-Precision-Seedling-Species-Analysis.git
   cd FloraFinder-Precision-Seedling-Species-Analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the dataset (details below) and place it in the `data` directory.

## Usage

To use FloraFinder, follow these steps:

1. **Preprocess the Images**:
   Before training the model, preprocess the images to ensure they are in the correct format and size.
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```

2. **Train the Model**:
   Train the model using the preprocessed images. This step involves feeding the images to the convolutional neural network (CNN) and letting it learn to classify the seedling species.
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**:
   After training, evaluate the model to check its performance. This involves running the model on a validation dataset and calculating metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   Finally, run the application to start classifying seedling species from new images. This will start a web interface where you can upload images and get classification results.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of labeled images of seedlings. It includes various species with multiple images per species to ensure robust training. You can download a similar dataset from [PlantVillage](https://github.com/spMohanty/PlantVillage-Dataset)【14†source】.

## Model Training

The training process involves:
- Loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- Defining the CNN architecture.
- Training the model on the training dataset.
- Validating the model on the validation dataset.

## Evaluation
